silica aerogel
fluorocarbon gas


A 5 cm-thick wall
of aerogel with refractive index n = 1.03 provide

The effective granularity of the
MaPMT photon detector is 3 mm×3 mm


 L = 85 cm path length between the aero-
gel and the spherical mirror. The refractive index
is n = 1.0014 for  λ = 260 nm



 (MaPMT). The
anodes are arranged in an 8 × 8 array of pixels,
each 2 mm×2 mm, separated by 0.3 mm gaps. The
vacuum tube envelope measures 25.7 mm×25.7 mm
resulting in a sensitive area of 48%.

The bialkali photocathode has a typical quan-
tum efficiency of 24% at maximum (380 nm), with
sensitivity extending from 600 nm down to 200 nm.


Each of the two RICH 1 photodetector planes
covers an area of 120 cm×52 cm. With MaPMT’s
packed at 28 mm pitch in modules of 16, then 110
modules or 1760 MaPMT’s are required


RICH 1 spherical mirrors have a radius of curvature
of 2400 mm.

Each half has dimension 1500 mm×775 mm
The mean reflectivity of the mirrors over the
wavelength range of interest (200 < λ < 600 nm) is
expected to be above 85%.

The spherical mirror surfaces have a radius
of curvature of 2400 mm projected onto a
820 mm×600 mm rectangle. The mirrors are po-
sitioned so that the virtual point where the spher-
ical surfaces intercept the z-axis is located at z =
1930 mm. The centres of curvature of the upper
and lower mirror assemblies are then positioned at
[x, y, z] = [0,±777.7, −340.5 mm] 


The flat mirrors have dimensions
370 mm×387 mm, arranged in two 4×2 planar ar-
rays above and below the beam. They are inclined
in the y-z projection and the planes lie between
[y, z]=[±350, 1310 mm] and [±1100, 1118.5 mm].
